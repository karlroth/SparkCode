# SparkCode
All Code written for processing D3S detector data

TODO:
1. Describe data in this README
2. Describe research project, goals, and accomplishments in README
3. Add descriptive comment headers to each file...

All spark code run in the Amazon EMR environment.

## DISCLAIMER:
These code examples alternate between using SparkSQL and DataFrame operations (often within the same file). I acknowledge that this might not be the best coding practice; this was done for my own learning purposes.
